# Airline-Point-Website
This is a website that provides an easy way to check the required miles for redeeming award tickets and the average cost of earning miles when purchasing tickets. It helps users in Canada find the most suitable airline among various Canadian carriers.

### How is this project unique?
After the pandemic, people have been earning airline miles through purchasing airline tickets (earning miles by flying), buying miles directly from airlines, using airline mileage credit cards offered by banks, or participating in other collaborative programs. With numerous airlines and their complex rules, travelers find it increasingly difficult to calculate how much they are spending to earn the corresponding miles or to determine which airline's mileage program best suits their needs. Currently, frequent flyers (or so-called mileage players) mostly share mileage-related information on platforms like Facebook or YouTube. However, this information is often unsuitable for newcomers to frequent flyer programs or those on tight budgets who have never considered the practicality of miles when purchasing tickets. This website aims to address these challenges by quickly analyzing the cost of earning miles and helping travelers find the best mileage strategies tailored to their needs, whether for redeeming award tickets or accessing other services.
